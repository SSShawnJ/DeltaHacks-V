# Tour++ | DeltaHacks-V
## Inspiration
When we travel to a new city, there are some points of interests (POI) that we all want to visit. However, most of us may just spend several minutes taking some photos and leave. We think this kind of travel experience is NOT OPTIMUM! We do think the tourists would like to know more about the history, the fun story behind these famous points of interests. 
## What it does
 As a result, we developed this Tour++ app, which can provide audio voice guide when the user is close to a POI. It can provide the user with the historic events, fun stories happened  at the POI like a tour guide. However, it can accompany you to anywhere in the world, working 24/7, and it is **FREE**! This is also used by the **VISUALLY IMPAIRED** population to greatly improve there travel experience.
## How we built it
We used nodeJS as the backend and pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript at the front end. We also used  Google Map API, Google Place Search API, Wikipedia API and Text-to-Speech API from ResponsiveVoice TM.
## Challenges we ran into
- Multithreading
- Learning Google map API, Google place search API, Wikipedia API
- Building front end scene (CSS)
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- We all think this app will be popular one day. Almost everyone like travel and want to get the most out of it.
- We get everything done in 24 hours!!! 
## What we learned
- New technology 
- Learnt to design, implement and sale the product.
## What's next for Tour++
- If we have more time, we will add more features like POI recommendation, tour planning. And in the future TOUR++ can also be used to book hotels, POI tickets any travel-related services.
